\section{Time-of-check to time-of-use}

Consider the following PHP code snippet handling a money transfer between two customers of the same bank. \textsc{a} has 500\$ in her account and she wants to transfer 400\$ to \textsc{b}'s account.

\begin{minted}[linenos, bgcolor=black, escapeinside=!!, startinline]{php}
// Check if A's balance is sufficient
$balanceA = query("SELECT balance FROM users WHERE id = A");
if ($balanceA < 400) {
    die("Insufficient balance");
}

// Calculate A's new balance
$balanceA -= 400;

// Store money transfer
query("UPDATE users SET balance = $balanceA WHERE id = A");
query("UPDATE users SET balance = balance + 400 WHERE id = B");
\end{minted}

Assume that \textsc{a} mistakenly (or purposely) requests the operation two times in a row (e.g. by clicking the ``Confirm'' button twice) on her home banking application, resulting in two (asynchronous) requests being sent to the server. In the worst case, the following could happen:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\thead[c]{\textbf{First request}} & \thead[c]{\textbf{Second request}} \\ \hline
\makecell[tl]{Check \textsc{a}'s balance \\ \hspace{12px} (\texttt{A=500, B=0, \$balanceA=500})} & \\
\rule{0pt}{4ex} & \makecell[tl]{Check \textsc{a}'s balance \\ \hspace{12px} (\texttt{A=500, B=0, \$balanceA=500})}  \\
\makecell[tl]{Calculate \textsc{a}'s new balance \\ \hspace{12px} (\texttt{A=500,  B=0, \$balanceA=100})} \rule{0pt}{4ex}  & \\
\rule{0pt}{4ex} & \makecell[tl]{Calculate \textsc{a}'s new balance \\ \hspace{12px} (\texttt{A=500, B=0, \$balanceA=100})} \\
\makecell[tl]{Store money transfer \\ \hspace{12px} (\texttt{A=100, B=400, \$balanceA=100})} \rule{0pt}{4ex} & \\
\rule{0pt}{4ex} & \makecell[tl]{Store money transfer \\ \hspace{12px} (\texttt{\textcolor{red}{A=100, B=800}, \$balanceA=100})} \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

\end{table}

\noindent
At the end of the process, \textsc{b} would end up with twice the money he was intended to receive.
